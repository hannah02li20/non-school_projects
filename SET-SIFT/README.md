# Instructions to run my solution code
Assuming that the input file is named "input.txt", run the main method in tests.java
If the input file name is not "input.txt", please go to line 12 in tests.java and change "input.txt" to "<insert name here>" and then run the main method in tests.java

I've added the examples given in the set challenge pdf as txt files on lines 13 and 14. If you want to verify that those return the correct output, please uncomment those lines (but make sure only one line out of 12, 13, or 14 is uncommented at a time).

# Concerns
I admit that I did not understand question 2 on the FAQ in the set challenge pdf. I don't have much experience working with input values through standard input, so I did hard code the file name into tests.java (as seen above in the instructions). I am eager to learn though, and will brush up and my knowledge of standard input if given a chance to intern at Sift, and even if I don't.
