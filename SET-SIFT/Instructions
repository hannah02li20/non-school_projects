    # I searched online for potential algorithms to complete this challenge and found this code by Henrik Warne
        https://github.com/henrikw/SetGame
    # In SetGame.java, I will note in front of every function whether it is my work or Mr. Warne's work
    # Everything in tests.java is my code


# colors: (1) yellow, (2) blue, (3) green
# symbols: (1) A, (2) S, (3) H
# shading: (1) lowercase a, s, h; (2) uppercase A, S, H; (3) symbolcase @, $, #
# number: the number of times the symbol appears, 1, 2, or 3

# possible card
    # blue $$$ = color: blue, symbol: S, shading: $, number: 3

# SETS
    # 3 cards are only a SET if:
        # all colors are different or all colors are the same
        # all symbols are different or all symbols are the same
        # all shadings are different or all shadings are the same
        # all numbers are different or all numbers are the same

# DISJOINT SETS
    # 2 sets are disjoint if:
        # there are NO common cards between them

# GOAL
    # 1) find and print the number of total SETS there are in the input
    # 2) find and print the largest disjoint collection of SETS in the input
